# Copywriting Skill

## 1. Overview

This skill operates in two distinct modes: **Write Mode** for creating new copy from scratch, and **Review Mode** for analyzing and improving existing copy. The skill adapts its workflow based on context, user intent, and the specific copywriting task at hand.

### Dual-Mode Operation

**Write Mode** activates when the user requests new copy creation. This includes requests for headlines, sales pages, email sequences, ad copy, landing pages, or any persuasive content. The workflow follows a structured five-stage process that prioritizes research before writing.

**Review Mode** activates when the user provides existing copy for critique, optimization, or improvement. This mode applies diagnostic frameworks to identify weaknesses and provides actionable recommendations grounded in proven copywriting principles.

### Adaptive Workflow

The skill adjusts depth and approach based on:
- **Task scope**: A single headline requires different treatment than a full sales letter
- **Audience awareness level**: Copy for cold traffic differs fundamentally from copy for warm leads
- **Medium constraints**: Email subject lines, Facebook ads, and long-form sales pages each have distinct requirements
- **User expertise**: Provide more foundational context for beginners, more advanced tactics for experienced marketers

## 2. The Copywriting Process

Follow these five stages sequentially. Rushing to write before completing research is the primary cause of weak copy.

### Stage 1: Research & Discovery

Before writing a single word of copy, gather intelligence on three fronts:

**Product/Service Research**
- What specific, measurable results does this deliver?
- What is the mechanism that makes it work?
- What makes this different from alternatives?
- What proof elements exist (testimonials, case studies, data)?

**Audience Research**
- What is their current situation and pain points?
- What have they already tried that failed?
- What do they secretly believe about their problem?
- What would their life look like if this problem were solved?

**Awareness Level Assessment**
As Schwartz identifies in Breakthrough Advertising, prospects exist on a spectrum:
1. **Unaware**: Does not know they have a problem
2. **Problem Aware**: Knows the problem, not the solutions
3. **Solution Aware**: Knows solutions exist, not your product
4. **Product Aware**: Knows your product, not convinced
5. **Most Aware**: Knows and trusts you, needs the right offer

The awareness level determines your opening strategy. Never lead with your product name to an unaware audience. Never waste words explaining the problem to a most-aware audience.

### Stage 2: Headline Development

Invest 80% of creative effort here. As Hopkins observed in Scientific Advertising, the headline determines whether the remaining copy gets read at all. A mediocre body with a great headline outperforms great body copy with a weak headline.

**Headline Functions**
- Stop the right reader (qualify your audience)
- Promise a specific benefit or arouse curiosity
- Set the tone for everything that follows

**Headline Formulas to Consider**
- Direct benefit: State the primary promise clearly
- News angle: Frame the offer as new information
- How-to: Promise practical instruction
- Question: Engage by asking what the reader is already wondering
- Command: Direct the reader to take mental or physical action
- Reason-why: Promise a numbered list of benefits or methods

Generate multiple headline variations (aim for 10-25 options) before selecting. Test the winner against runners-up when possible.

### Stage 3: Lead/Opening

The lead must accomplish a seamless handoff from headline to body. The reader who was intrigued enough to continue must immediately feel rewarded for that decision.

**Lead Types by Awareness Level**
- **Unaware**: Story lead or provocative statement that makes them recognize themselves
- **Problem Aware**: Agitate the pain, show you understand their frustration
- **Solution Aware**: Differentiate your mechanism from what they have tried
- **Product Aware**: Lead with proof, social validation, or a compelling offer
- **Most Aware**: Lead with the offer, get to the point immediately

The lead should create enough momentum that the reader cannot stop. Each sentence sells the next sentence.

### Stage 4: Body Copy

Structure the body using the SUCCESs framework that Heath and Heath articulate in Made to Stick:

**S - Simple**: Find the core message. Ruthlessly eliminate complexity. If you try to say ten things, you say nothing.

**U - Unexpected**: Break patterns to capture attention. Use surprising statistics, counterintuitive claims, or pattern interrupts that make readers pause.

**C - Concrete**: Replace abstractions with sensory details. Not "save time" but "reclaim your Sunday mornings." As Hopkins emphasized, specificity sells. "37% faster" beats "much faster."

**C - Credible**: Build belief through specifics, demonstrations, testimonials, credentials, and verifiable claims. Anticipate skepticism and address it directly.

**E - Emotional**: Connect benefits to feelings. People buy on emotion and justify with logic. Identify the dominant emotion driving the purchase decision.

**S - Stories**: Use narrative to carry your message. Stories create mental simulation and bypass resistance that pure argumentation triggers.

Throughout the body, apply Cialdini's six principles of influence where appropriate:
- **Reciprocity**: Give value before asking for action
- **Commitment/Consistency**: Get small yeses that lead to the big yes
- **Social Proof**: Show others like them who have succeeded
- **Authority**: Establish credibility and expertise
- **Liking**: Build rapport and genuine connection
- **Scarcity**: Create legitimate urgency through limited time or availability

### Stage 5: CTA & Close

The close converts interest into action. A strong close includes:

**Clear, Single Action**: Tell them exactly what to do next. Confusion kills conversion.

**Reason to Act Now**: As Schwartz notes, urgency must be real and logical. False scarcity destroys trust.

**Risk Reversal**: Remove barriers to action through guarantees, trials, or demonstrations of confidence.

**Future Pacing**: Help them visualize life after taking action. Paint the picture of their transformed situation.

## 3. Core Principles

These foundational principles inform all copywriting decisions:

### From Hopkins: Scientific Advertising
- **Specificity wins**: "36.7% improvement" is more believable than "huge improvement"
- **Test everything**: Opinions are worthless; measured results are everything
- **Serve, do not shout**: Good copy is salesmanship in print, not boasting
- **One thing at a time**: Each ad, each email, each page should have one job

### From Cialdini: Influence
- **Reciprocity**: Give genuine value and readers feel compelled to reciprocate
- **Commitment/Consistency**: Small agreements lead to larger ones
- **Social Proof**: We look to others to determine correct behavior
- **Authority**: Credentialed expertise creates automatic compliance
- **Liking**: We say yes to people we like and who are like us
- **Scarcity**: Limited availability increases perceived value

### From Schwartz: Breakthrough Advertising
- **Meet them where they are**: Match message to awareness level
- **Channel desire, do not create it**: Tap into existing wants
- **Sophistication matters**: In crowded markets, old promises need new mechanisms
- **Mass desire is the fuel**: Your copy directs it; your copy does not create it

### From Heath & Heath: Made to Stick
- **Simple**: Core message, stripped to essentials
- **Unexpected**: Violate expectations to earn attention
- **Concrete**: Sensory, specific, tangible language
- **Credible**: Verifiable, demonstrable, believable
- **Emotional**: Connect to feelings and identity
- **Stories**: Narrative structures that simulate and inspire

## 4. Mode Instructions

### Write Mode Workflow

1. **Clarify the brief**: Confirm product, audience, medium, and goal
2. **Assess awareness level**: Determine where the audience sits on Schwartz's spectrum
3. **Load relevant references**: Pull applicable frameworks based on task type
4. **Execute the five stages**: Research, Headline, Lead, Body, CTA
5. **Present output with rationale**: Explain strategic choices, especially for headlines
6. **Offer variations**: Provide alternatives for testing when appropriate

### Review Mode Workflow

1. **Read the copy completely**: Understand the full context before critiquing
2. **Identify the intended audience and goal**: Clarify what success looks like
3. **Assess against core principles**: Check alignment with Hopkins, Cialdini, Schwartz, Heath
4. **Diagnose specific weaknesses**: Be precise about what is not working and why
5. **Provide actionable fixes**: Do not just identify problems; suggest specific solutions
6. **Prioritize recommendations**: Indicate which changes will have the greatest impact

## 5. Citation Style

Reference source authors naturally within the copy guidance. Integrate their wisdom as established principles rather than academic citations.

**Preferred Phrasing**
- "As Schwartz notes, the awareness level determines your opening strategy..."
- "Hopkins would remind us that specificity is the soul of believability..."
- "This aligns with what Cialdini calls the commitment and consistency principle..."
- "The Heath brothers would categorize this as a 'concrete' detail that sticks..."

Avoid footnote-style citations or parenthetical references. The goal is to invoke authority conversationally, as an experienced copywriter would reference mentors and masters of the craft.

1. Determine the primary task type from the user request
2. Load the corresponding reference file(s)
3. Apply relevant frameworks from loaded references
4. Cross-reference with core principles (always available)
5. If task spans multiple types (e.g., "write a landing page with email follow-up"), load all applicable references

### Specialized Commands

For landing page optimization work, the `/copy-lpo` command provides a focused workflow with pre-loaded landing page frameworks and testing methodology.

## Implementation Notes

When executing this skill:

1. **Never skip research**: Even for simple tasks, confirm audience and goal before writing
2. **Headlines first**: Generate headline options before drafting body copy
3. **Match sophistication to audience**: Experienced marketers want advanced tactics; beginners need foundations
4. **Explain your choices**: Transparency about strategy builds trust and educates the user
5. **Offer to iterate**: Good copy emerges through revision; invite feedback and refinement
6. **Stay practical**: Theory serves practice; every principle should connect to actionable output

The goal is copy that converts. Every technique, framework, and principle exists to serve that singular outcome.
